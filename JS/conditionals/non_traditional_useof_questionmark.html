        // Sometimes the question mark ? is used as a replacement for if:

        let company = prompt("Which company created JavaScript?");

        (company == "Netscape") ?
            alert("Right!") : alert("Wrong!");

        // Depending on the condition company == 'Netscape', either the first or the second expression after the ? gets executed and shows an alert.

        // We don’t assign a result to a variable here. Instead, we execute different code depending on the condition.

        // It’s not recommended to use the question mark operator in this way.

        // The notation is shorter than the equivalent if statement, which appeals to some programmers. But it is less readable.

        // Here is the same code using if for comparison:

        // let company = prompt('Which company created JavaScript?', '');

        // if (company == 'Netscape') {
        //     alert('Right!');
        // } else {
        //     alert('Wrong.');
        // }

        // Our eyes scan the code vertically. Code blocks which span several lines are easier to understand than a long, horizontal instruction set.

        // The purpose of the question mark operator ? is to return one value or another depending on its condition. Please use it for exactly that. Use if when you need to execute different branches of code.
